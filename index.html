              <p>C# is a hybrid of C and C++, it is a Microsoft programming language developed to compete with Sun's Java language. C# is an object-oriented programming language used with XML-based Web services on the .NET platform and designed for improving productivity in the development of Web applications.</p>

              <p>C# boasts type-safety, garbage collection, simplified type declarations, versioning and scalability support, and other features that make developing solutions faster and easier, especially for COM+ and Web services. Microsoft critics have pointed to the similarities between C# and Java.</p>

              <p>Ruby is a simple but powerful object-oriented programming language (everything in Ruby is an object), created by Yukihiro Matsumoto, who goes by the online name "Matz." Ruby programs are compact, yet readable and maintainable. Ruby offers features such as blocks, iterators, meta-classes and others. It can be used to write servers, to experiment with prototypes, and for everyday programming tasks. Ruby is open source and freely available for both development and deployment.</p>
